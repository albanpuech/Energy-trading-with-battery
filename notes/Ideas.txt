Directions/ Ideas before litt. review :

DAM auction only :

1. Need for prediction of the MCP prices of the DAM + **prediction accuracy** 
2. Create first schedule based on those prices.
3. Execute shedule. No need to update for current day since legally binding

DAM + Intraday :

1. Need for prediction of the MCP prices of the DAM + **prediction accuracy** 
2. Create first schedule based on those prices with reserve.
3. Execute shedule and update it to take advantage of the ID market while respecting binging agreements
